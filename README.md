# Flatland_project
Project for the Foundations of Reinforcement Learning course at ETH - HS2021

# Getting started
## On Euler ETH cluster
In order to get started, we provide a ```set_up_euler.sh``` bash script that should setup the environment correctly for you to run our code.

## On your own device
We recommand you follow the official guide in order to install the Flatland environment: https://flatland.aicrowd.com/getting-started/installation.html

# How to use the repo
The ```run.sh``` script as well as the utils folder are related to submission on the Flatland challenge (which is now closed).

Code of interest for the project is in the baseline folder. We provide a detailed Readme concerning this part in this folder.
